Searching an ARRAY with ANY
As we saw in the video, PostgreSQL also provides the ability to filter results by searching for values in an ARRAY. 
The ANY function allows you to search for a value in any index position of an ARRAY. Here's an example.

WHERE 'search text' = ANY(array_name)
When using the ANY function, the value you are filtering on appears on the left side of the equation with the name of the ARRAY column as the parameter in the ANY function.

Searching an ARRAY with @>
The contains operator @> operator is alternative syntax to the ANY function and matches data in an ARRAY using the following syntax.

WHERE array_name @> ARRAY['search text'] :: type[]
So let's practice using this operator in the exercise below.

/*
Adding and subtracting date and time values
In this exercise, you will calculate the actual number of days rented as well as the true expected_return_date by using the rental_duration column from the film table along 
with the familiar rental_date from the rental table.

This will require that you dust off the skills you learned from prior courses on how to join two or more tables together. To select columns from both the film and rental tables 
in a single query, we'll need to use the inventory table to join these two tables together 
since there is no explicit relationship between them. Let's give it a try!
*/

/*
INTERVAL arithmetic
If you were running a real DVD Rental store, there would be times when you would need to determine what film titles were currently out for rental with customers. 
In the previous exercise, we saw that some of the records in the results had a NULL value for the return_date. This is because the rental was still outstanding.

Each rental in the film table has an associated rental_duration column which represents the number of days that a DVD can be rented by a customer before it is considered late. 
In this example, you will exclude films that have a NULL value for the return_date and also convert the rental_duration to an INTERVAL type. Here's a reminder of one method
 for performing this conversion.

SELECT INTERVAL '1' day * timestamp '2019-04-10 12:34:56'
*/

--Convert rental_duration by multiplying it with a 1 day INTERVAL

 	-- Convert the rental_duration to an interval
    INTERVAL '1' day * f.rental_duration AS rental_duration,
 	-- Calculate the days rented as we did previously

WHERE r.return_date IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY f.title;

/*
Calculating the expected return date
So now that you've practiced how to add and subtract timestamps and perform relative calculations using intervals, let's use those new skills to calculate the actual expected return date of a specific rental. As you've seen in previous exercises, the rental_duration is the number of days allowed for a rental before it's considered late. To calculate the expected_return_date you will want to use the rental_duration and add it to the rental_date.

*/

--Convert rental_duration by multiplying it with a 1-day INTERVAL.

Current timestamp functions
Use the console to explore the NOW(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE and CURRENT_TIME functions and their outputs to determine which of the following is not correct?
*/

select NOW(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME

Possible Answers
NOW() returns the current date and time as a timestamp with timezone.
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP returns the current timestamp without timezone.  <--not currect
CURRENT_DATE returns the current date value without a time value.
CURRENT_TIME returns the current time value without a date value.

--Select the current timestamp without a timezone
SELECT CAST( NOW() AS timestamp )

SELECT 
	-- Select the current date
	CURRENT_DATE,

--Select the current timestamp without timezone

/*
Using EXTRACT
You can use EXTRACT() and DATE_PART() to easily create new fields in your queries by extracting sub-fields from a source timestamp field.

Now suppose you want to produce a predictive model that will help forecast DVD rental activity by day of the week. 
You could use the EXTRACT() function with the dow field identifier in our query to create a new field called dayofweek as a sub-field of the rental_date column from the rental table.

You can COUNT() the number of records in the rental table for a given date range and aggregate by the newly created dayofweek column.

/*
Using DATE_TRUNC
The DATE_TRUNC() function will truncate timestamp or interval data types to return a timestamp or interval at a specified precision. 
The precision values are a subset of the field identifiers that can be used with the EXTRACT() and DATE_PART() functions. 
DATE_TRUNC() will return an interval or timestamp rather than a number. For example

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', TIMESTAMP '2005-05-21 15:30:30');
Result: 2005-05-01 00;00:00

Now, let's experiment with different precisions and ultimately modify the queries from the previous exercises to aggregate rental activity.
