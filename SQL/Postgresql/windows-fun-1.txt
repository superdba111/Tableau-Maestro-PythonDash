Numbering rows
The simplest application for window functions is numbering rows. Numbering rows allows you to easily fetch the nth row. For example, 
it would be very difficult to get the 35th row in any given table if you didn't have a column with each row's number

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Number each row in the dataset.
SELECT
  *,
  -- Assign numbers to each row
  ROW_NUMBER() over() AS Row_N
FROM Summer_Medals
ORDER BY Row_N ASC;

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Numbering Olympic games in ascending order
The Summer Olympics dataset contains the results of the games between 1896 and 2012. The first Summer Olympics were held in 1896, the second in 1900, and so on. 
What if you want to easily query the table to see in which year the 13th Summer Olympics were held? You'd need to number the rows for that.

--Assign a number to each year in which Summer Olympic games were held.

SELECT
  Year,

  -- Assign numbers to each year
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS Row_N
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT Year
  FROM Summer_Medals
  ORDER BY Year ASC
) AS Years
ORDER BY Year ASC;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moving maximum of Scandinavian athletes' medals
Frames allow you to restrict the rows passed as input to your window function to a sliding window for you to define the start and finish.

Adding a frame to your window function allows you to calculate "moving" metrics, inputs of which slide from row to row.

--Return the year, medals earned, and the maximum medals earned, comparing only the current year and the next year

WITH Scandinavian_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country IN ('DEN', 'NOR', 'FIN', 'SWE', 'ISL')
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
  GROUP BY Year)

SELECT
  -- Select each year's medals
  Year,
  Medals,
  -- Get the max of the current and next years'  medals
  MAX(Medals) OVER (ORDER BY Year ASC
                    ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW
                    AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS Max_Medals
FROM Scandinavian_Medals
ORDER BY Year ASC;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moving maximum of Chinese athletes' medals
Frames allow you "peak" forwards or backward without first using the relative fetching functions, LAG and LEAD, to fetch previous rows' values into the current row.

--Return the athletes, medals earned, and the maximum medals earned, comparing only the last two and current athletes, ordering by athletes' names in alphabetical order.

WITH Chinese_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'CHN' AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Athlete)

SELECT
  -- Select the athletes and the medals they've earned
  Athlete,
  Medals,
  -- Get the max of the last two and current rows' medals 
  MAX(Medals) OVER (ORDER BY Athlete ASC
                    ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING
                    AND CURRENT ROW) AS Max_Medals
FROM Chinese_Medals
ORDER BY Athlete ASC;


Numbering Olympic games in descending order
You've already numbered the rows in the Summer Medals dataset. What if you need to reverse the row numbers so that the most recent Olympic games' rows have a lower number?

SELECT
  Year,
  -- Assign the lowest numbers to the most recent years
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Year DESC) AS Row_N
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT Year
  FROM Summer_Medals
) AS Years
ORDER BY Year;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numbering Olympic athletes by medals earned
Row numbering can also be used for ranking. For example, numbering rows and ordering by the count of medals each athlete earned in the OVER clause will
 assign 1 to the highest-earning medalist, 2 to the second highest-earning medalist, and so on.


WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    -- Count the number of medals each athlete has earned
    Athlete,
    COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  GROUP BY Athlete)

SELECT
  -- Number each athlete by how many medals they've earned
  Athlete,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Row_N
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Medals DESC;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reigning weightlifting champions
A reigning champion is a champion who's won both the previous and current years' competitions. To determine if a champion is reigning, 
the previous and current years' results need to be in the same row, in two different columns.

SELECT
  -- Return each year's champions' countries
  year,
  country AS champion
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Discipline = 'Weightlifting' AND
  Event = '69KG' AND
  Gender = 'Men' AND
  Medal = 'Gold';


--Having wrapped the previous query in the Weightlifting_Gold CTE, get the previous year's champion for each year.

  SELECT
    -- Return each year's champions' countries
    Year,
    Country AS champion
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Discipline = 'Weightlifting' AND
    Event = '69KG' AND
    Gender = 'Men' AND
    Medal = 'Gold')

SELECT
  Year, Champion,
  -- Fetch the previous year's champion
  LAG(Champion) OVER
    (order by year ASC) AS Last_Champion
FROM Weightlifting_Gold
ORDER BY Year ASC;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reigning champions by gender
You've already fetched the previous year's champion for one event. However, if you have multiple events, genders, or other metrics as columns,
 you'll need to split your table into partitions to avoid having a champion from one event or gender appear as the previous champion of another event or gender.

--Return the previous champions of each year's event by gender.

WITH Tennis_Gold AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    Gender, Year, Country
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Year >= 2000 AND
    Event = 'Javelin Throw' AND
    Medal = 'Gold')

SELECT
  Gender, Year,
  Country AS Champion,
  -- Fetch the previous year's champion by gender
  LAG(Country) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender
                         ORDER BY Year ASC) AS Last_Champion
FROM Tennis_Gold
ORDER BY Gender ASC, Year ASC;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reigning champions by gender and event
In the previous exercise, you partitioned by gender to ensure that data about one gender doesn't get mixed into data about the other gender. 
If you have multiple columns, however, partitioning by only one of them will still mix the results of the other columns.

--Return the previous champions of each year's events by gender and event

WITH Athletics_Gold AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    Gender, Year, Event, Country
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Year >= 2000 AND
    Discipline = 'Athletics' AND
    Event IN ('100M', '10000M') AND
    Medal = 'Gold')

SELECT
  Gender, Year, Event,
  Country AS Champion,
  -- Fetch the previous year's champion by gender and event
  LAG(Country) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender, Event
                         ORDER BY Year ASC) AS Last_Champion
FROM Athletics_Gold
ORDER BY Event ASC, Gender ASC, Year ASC;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future gold medalists
Fetching functions allow you to get values from different parts of the table into one row. If you have time-ordered data, 
you can "peek into the future" with the LEAD fetching function. 

WITH Discus_Medalists AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    Year,
    Athlete
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Event = 'Discus Throw'
    AND Gender = 'Women'
    AND Year >= 2000)

SELECT
  -- For each year, fetch the current and future medalists
  year,
  athlete,
  LEAD(athlete, 3) OVER (ORDER BY year ASC) AS Future_Champion
FROM Discus_Medalists
ORDER BY Year ASC;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First athlete by name
It's often useful to get the first or last value in a dataset to compare all other values to it. With absolute fetching functions like FIRST_VALUE, you can fetch a value at an absolute position in the table, like its beginning or end.

Return all athletes and the first athlete ordered by alphabetical order.

WITH All_Male_Medalists AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    Athlete
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Gender = 'Men')

SELECT
  -- Fetch all athletes and the first althete alphabetically
  athlete,
  FIRST_VALUE(Athlete) OVER (
    ORDER BY Athlete ASC
  ) AS First_Athlete
FROM All_Male_Medalists;
This is especially useful if you want to compare a current value to a future value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last country by name
Just like you can get the first row's value in a dataset, you can get the last row's value. This is often useful when you want to compare the most recent value to previous values.
Return the year and the city in which each Olympic games were held.
Fetch the last city in which the Olympic games were held.

WITH Hosts AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT Year, City
    FROM Summer_Medals)

SELECT
  Year,
  City,
  -- Get the last city in which the Olympic games were held
  LAST_VALUE(city) OVER (
   ORDER BY year ASC
   RANGE BETWEEN
     UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND
     UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
  ) AS Last_City
FROM Hosts
ORDER BY Year ASC;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Rank each athlete by the number of medals they've earned -- the higher the count, the higher the rank -- with identical numbers in case of identical values.

WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete,
    COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  GROUP BY Athlete)

SELECT
  Athlete,
  Medals,
  -- Rank athletes by the medals they've won
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Row_N
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Medals DESC;


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranking athletes from multiple countries
In the previous exercise, you used RANK to assign rankings to one group of athletes. In real-world data, however, you'll often find numerous groups within your data. 
Without partitioning your data, one group's values will influence the rankings of the others.

Also, while RANK skips numbers in case of identical values, the most natural way to assign rankings is not to skip numbers. 
If two countries are tied for second place, the country after them is considered to be third by most people.

--Rank each country's athletes by the count of medals they've earned -- the higher the count, the higher the rank -- without skipping numbers in case of identical values

WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Country, Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country IN ('JPN', 'KOR')
    AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Country, Athlete
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)

SELECT
  Country,
  -- Rank athletes in each country by the medals they've won
  Athlete,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY country
                ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Rank_N
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Country ASC, RANK_N ASC;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paging events
There are exactly 666 unique events in the Summer Medals Olympics dataset. If you want to chunk them up to analyze them piece by piece, 
you'll need to split the events into groups of approximately equal size.

--Split the distinct events into exactly 111 groups, ordered by event in alphabetical order.

WITH Events AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT Event
  FROM Summer_Medals)
  
SELECT
  --- Split up the distinct events into 111 unique groups
  Event,
  NTILE(111) OVER (ORDER BY Event ASC) AS Page
FROM Events
ORDER BY Event ASC;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Top, middle, and bottom thirds
Splitting your data into thirds or quartiles is often useful to understand how the values in your dataset are spread. 
Getting summary statistics (averages, sums, standard deviations, etc.) of the top, middle, and bottom thirds can help you determine what distribution your values follow.

--Split the athletes into top, middle, and bottom thirds based on their count of medals.

WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  GROUP BY Athlete
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
  
SELECT
  Athlete,
  Medals,
  -- Split athletes into thirds by their earned medals
  NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Third
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Medals DESC, Athlete ASC;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  GROUP BY Athlete
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1),
  
  Thirds AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete,
    Medals,
    NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Third
  FROM Athlete_Medals)
  
SELECT
  -- Get the average medals earned in each third
  Third,
  AVG(Medals) AS Avg_Medals
FROM Thirds
GROUP BY Third
ORDER BY Third ASC;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running totals of athlete medals
The running total (or cumulative sum) of a column helps you determine what each row's contribution is to the total sum.

--Return the athletes, the number of medals they earned, and the medals running total, ordered by the athletes' names in alphabetical order.

WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'USA' AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Athlete)

SELECT
  -- Calculate the running total of athlete medals
  Athlete,
  Medals,
  SUM(Medals) OVER (ORDER BY Athlete ASC) AS Max_Medals
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Athlete ASC;

---------------------------------------
Maximum country medals by year
Getting the maximum of a country's earned medals so far helps you determine whether a country has broken its medals record 
by comparing the current year's earned medals and the maximum so far.

--Return the year, country, medals, and the maximum medals earned so far for each country, ordered by year in ascending order.

WITH Country_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, Country, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country IN ('CHN', 'KOR', 'JPN')
    AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Year, Country)

SELECT
  -- Return the max medals earned so far per country
  Country,
  Year,
  Medals,
  MAX(Medals) OVER (PARTITION BY Country
                        ORDER BY Year ASC) AS Max_Medals
FROM Country_Medals
ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minimum country medals by year
So far, you've seen MAX and SUM, aggregate functions normally used with GROUP BY, being used as window functions. You can also use the other aggregate functions, like MIN, as window functions.

--Return the year, medals earned, and minimum medals earned so far

WITH France_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'FRA'
    AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Year)

SELECT
  Year,
  Medals,
  Min(medals) OVER (ORDER BY year ASC) AS Min_Medals
FROM France_Medals
ORDER BY Year ASC;

     ORDER BY Year ASC
     ROWS BETWEEN
     2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS Medals_MA
FROM Country_Medals
ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A basic pivot
You have the following table of Pole Vault gold medalist countries by gender in 2008 and 2012.

| Gender | Year | Country |
|--------|------|---------|
| Men    | 2008 | AUS     |
| Men    | 2012 | FRA     |
| Women  | 2008 | RUS     |
| Women  | 2012 | USA     |
Pivot it by Year to get the following reshaped, cleaner table.

| Gender | 2008 | 2012 |

Pivoting with ranking
You want to produce an easy scannable table of the rankings of the three most populous EU countries by how many gold medals they've earned in the 2004 through 2012 Olympic games. The table needs to be in this format:

| Country | 2004 | 2008 | 2012 |
|---------|------|------|------|
| FRA     | ...  | ...  | ...  |
| GBR     | ...  | ...  | ...  |
| GER     | ...  | ...  | ...  |
You'll need to count the gold medals each country has earned, produce the ranks of each country by medals earned, then pivot the table to this shape.

--Count the gold medals that France (FRA), the UK (GBR), and Germany (GER) have earned per country and year.

-- Count the gold medals per country and year

Country-level subtotals
You want to look at three Scandinavian countries' earned gold medals per country and gender in the year 2000.
 You're also interested in Country-level subtotals to get the total medals earned for each country,
 but Gender-level subtotals don't make much sense in this case, so disregard them.

Count the gold medals awarded per country and gender.
Generate Country-level gold award counts.

-- Count the gold medals per country and gender
SELECT
  Country,
  Gender,
  COUNT(*) AS Gold_Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Year = 2004
  AND Medal = 'Gold'
  AND Country IN ('DEN', 'NOR', 'SWE')
-- Generate Country-level subtotals
GROUP BY Country, ROLLUP(Gender)
ORDER BY Country ASC, Gender ASC;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All group-level subtotals
You want to break down all medals awarded to Russia in the 2012 Olympic games per gender and medal type. 
Since the medals all belong to one country, Russia, it makes sense to generate all possible subtotals (Gender- and Medal-level subtotals), as well as a grand total.

Generate a breakdown of the medals awarded to Russia per country and medal type, including all group-level subtotals and a grand total.

Select Gender and Medal, counting the medals awarded with COUNT(*).
Using ROLLUP(Gender, Medal) won't provide any Medal-level counts in the result, whereas using Gender, ROLLUP(Medal) will.

-- Count the medals per country and medal type
SELECT
  Gender,
  Medal,
  COUNT(*) AS Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Year = 2012
  AND Country = 'RUS'
-- Get all possible group-level subtotals
GROUP BY CUBE(Gender, Medal)
ORDER BY Gender ASC, Medal ASC;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cleaning up results
Returning to the breakdown of Scandinavian awards you previously made, you want to clean up the results by replacing the nulls with meaningful text.

Turn the nulls in the Country column to All countries, and the nulls in the Gender column to All genders.

SELECT
  -- Replace the nulls in the columns with meaningful text
  COALESCE(Country, 'All countries') AS Country,
  COALESCE(Gender, 'All genders') AS Gender,
  COUNT(*) AS Awards
FROM Summer_Medals

  AND Medal = 'Gold'
  AND Country IN ('DEN', 'NOR', 'SWE')
GROUP BY ROLLUP(Country, Gender)
ORDER BY Country ASC, Gender ASC;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summarizing results
After ranking each country in the 2000 Olympics by gold medals awarded, you want to return the top 3 countries in one row, as a comma-separated string. In other words, turn this:

| Country | Rank |
|---------|------|
| USA     | 1    |
| RUS     | 2    |
| AUS     | 3    |
| ...     | ...  |
into this:

USA, RUS, AUS

Rank countries by the medals they've been awarded.
Use RANK, ordering by Medals in descending order in the OVER clause.
