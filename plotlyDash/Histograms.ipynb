    "A histogram is an accurate representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable (quantitative variable) and was first introduced by Karl Pearson.[1] It differs from a bar graph, in the sense that a bar graph relates two variables, but a histogram relates only one. To construct a histogram, the first step is to \"bin\" the range of values—that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals—and then count how many values fall into each interval. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The bins (intervals) must be adjacent, and are often (but are not required to be) of equal size\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms are sometimes confused with bar charts. A histogram is used for continuous data, where the bins represent ranges of data, while a bar chart is a plot of categorical variables. Some authors recommend that bar charts have gaps between the rectangles to clarify the distinction, The major difference is that a histogram is only used to plot the frequency of score occurrences in a continuous data set that has been divided into classes, called bins. Bar charts, on the other hand, can be used for a great deal of other types of variables including ordinal and nominal data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "when to use it---The histogram is suitable for visualizing distribution of numerical data over a continuous interval, or a certain time period. The key to use it is how to select bin size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages\n",
    "The histogram organizes large amounts of data, and produces a visualization quickly, using a single dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "The histogram is not relevant for detailed analysis of the data as it deals with a summary of the data distribution."
